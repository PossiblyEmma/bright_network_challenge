https://bn-hiring-challenge.fly.dev/members.json

https://bn-hiring-challenge.fly.dev/jobs.json

For each member, please print their name and their recommended job(s).

Please work in a git repository, and share the repository with us via either a link or zip file. Please include a README which contains, at a minimum, instructions for installing and running your submission, a brief acknowledgement of the challenges posed by the problem and its domain and a discussion of the choices you've made and your reasons. Think of the README as a one-sided pre-interview conversation on the problem and your submission.
